This website provides a reference for beginners who are using R in 
university courses (and beyond).  Throughout the website, we will
include many code examples.  These code examples are live. You can 
edit the code and re-run it to see how things change. 

:::{your-turn}

Give it a try.  Run the code below to calculate `1 + 1`.
Then see if you can get R to compute the product 3 * 5
in the code block below.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1_r
1 + 1

```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1_r
#| check: true
results <- Filter(\(x) inherits(x, "result"), .evaluate_result)
if(is.null(Find(\(x) x$value == 15, results))) {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = "Incorrect, sorry.")
} else {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = "Correct!")
}
```
